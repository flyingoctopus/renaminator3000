# Renameinator 3000 🤖

Welcome to the **Renameinator 3000** — the only tool you'll ever need to make sense of the chaos that is your torrent downloads directory! Say goodbye to files named `IMG_9485739-XXFINAL-FINAL-V2.mkv` and hello to `The.Office.S03E05.1080p.2024.mkv`! 🎉

## What Does It Do?

The **Renameinator 3000** takes all those weird, cryptic filenames and turns them into a beautiful, human-readable format. It’s like a spa day for your files.

## Usage

Simply run the script from your command line like so:

```bash
python rename_of_thrones.py /path/to/client_directory
```
May the blood of your namenies be forever on your sword. 🗡️

## Disclaimer
This script is not responsible for any accidental renaming of files that reveal embarrassing contents. Always review before running! 🔍
Why Use This?

    Your boss told you to.
    You have OCD and filenames like Copy of Copy of Final Report 2021 (Final).docx make your eye twitch.
    You just love a good .md file.

## Contributions
I'd like to thank a single Titan RTX munching on 7b llama parameters with a whole lot of gumption for the regex support (I guess I did stuff too). 🦙

Feel free to contribute, complain, or send us coffee. ☕ If you manage to break this script in a new and exciting way, let me know!

Happy Renaming! 🚀
